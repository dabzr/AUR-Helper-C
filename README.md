# AUR-Helper-C
That's a very simple AUR Helper project that i made just to train code.
That AUR-Helper just install the programs, you can't update or remove them by that program and sometimes it has some dependencies problem (that i'll try to solve). That means that the program it's not usable, it's just made for knowledge purposes.

## Example:
